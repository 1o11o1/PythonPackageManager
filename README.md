# PythonPackageManager
This is a private project. I am still a beginner in programming and at some point I realised that there are a lot of Pyhton packages. I wanted to have a simple method that I have an overview of which packages I have and that I can update or uninstall them quickly and easily.

So I wrote a Python file called app.py. But to make it easier for the user, I also created a batch file. The user can start the Batch-File as normal and then the browser opens and you can see the Streamlit-UI. If a package is missing, which is needed for the script. It will be downloaded automatically. The following packages are required: streamlit, subprocess, os and signal. 

The script fulfils the following function: The user receives an overview of which Python packages are installed on the computer. The user also has the option to delete individual packages or to see which functions the packages fulfil. If the user scrolls down further, the user receives a list of packages that can be updated. Finally, the user can install individual Python-packages. 

The Streamlit-UI looks like this:
